Finding the average amount paid by the top 5 customers: (using common table expressions (CTE) and join)

WITH average_total_amount_paid_cte(customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country) AS
(SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country,
SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id=B.customer_id
INNER JOIN Address C on B.address_id=C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id=D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id=E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Pinxiang', 'Sivas', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Celaya', 'Netzahuacyotl', 'Atlixco')
GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average_amount_paid
FROM average_total_amount_paid_cte

I first defined the CTE using the WITH clause (average_total_amount_paid_cte). Next, I provided the AS keyword and parenthesized the subquery. 
Finally, I wrote the main statement to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers in the top 10 cities.


Finding out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:

WITH top_customer_count_cte(customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country) AS
(SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country,
SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id=B.customer_id
INNER JOIN Address C on B.address_id=C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id=D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id=E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Pinxiang', 'Sivas', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Celaya', 'Netzahuacyotl', 'Atlixco')
GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5),
all_customer_count_cte AS
(SELECT E.country, COUNT(DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT E.country) as top_customer_count
FROM country E
INNER JOIN city D ON E.country_id=D.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON D.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer B ON C.address_id=B.address_id
GROUP BY E.country)
SELECT E.country,
COUNT(DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT top_customer_count_cte.customer_id)
AS top_customer_count
FROM country E
INNER JOIN city D ON E.country_id=D.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON D.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer B ON C.address_id=B.address_id
LEFT JOIN top_customer_count_cte ON E.country=top_customer_count_cte.country
GROUP BY E.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
